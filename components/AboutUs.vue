        <p>
          Founded in the heart of the Pacific Northwest, Boyer Towing – also
          known as Boyer Logistics – has been a pillar of maritime excellence
          since the 1920s. Our story begins with Boyer Halvorsen, who
          ambitiously started towing logs and hauling freight on Puget Sound.
