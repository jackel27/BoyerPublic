# Boyer - Job Management Application and Website

This project serves as a showcase of my coding abilities for potential employers. The application is a job management system built with Nuxt.js, Firebase, and Pinia. I'm using Bootstrap 5. It also serves as displaying the company, what they do, etc..
This is currently a work in progress.

## Project Overview

The Boyer application is a job management system where users can view and manage job postings.  It also serves as displaying the company, what they do, etc.. The application showcases the use of:
- Node for the backend hosting and project initialization.
- Nuxt.js for building the frontend UI of the application.
- Firebase as the backend service to handle data storage and retrieval.
- Pinia as the state management solution.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- **Job Listings:** Users can view a list of active job postings.
- **Job Applications:** Users can apply to open jobs, with applications stored and retrievable for review.
- **Job Posting Management:** Users can post, update, and close job postings.
- **Applicant Review:** Users can view applicants for each job and review their applications.
-  **Company Information:** Showcasing the company, it's values, information, and more.

## Code Organization

The project follows a modular structure with code organized according to feature. Each feature module includes its own state and actions within the Pinia store.

For instance, the `jobs` module handles everything related to job listings, applications, and management. It defines the state and actions related to these features.

## Further Improvements

There is always room for improvement. Here are a few things that could be done to further enhance this application:
- **UI:** Adding more content, adjusting the UI, and fine tuning. This is still a work in progress.
- **Testing:** Implementing unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and correctness.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Improving the user interface and user experience based on user feedback and usability studies.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Profiling the application to find and optimize performance bottlenecks.

## Note

This is my first project using Nuxt.js. I usually choose vue.js JavaScript Framework, or just Vanilla JS, but I wanted to try something new. This project is not intended for production use and does not include setup instructions. It serves as a showcase of my skills and abilities as a developer.
